    "> Python is a flexible language, and there are several ways to use it depending on your particular task.\n",
    "One thing that distinguishes Python from other programming languages is that it is *interpreted* rather than *compiled*.\n",
    "This means that it is executed line by line, which allows programming to be interactive in a way that is not directly possible with compiled languages like Fortran, C, or Java. This section will describe four primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, the *IPython interpreter*, via *Self-contained Scripts*, or in the *Jupyter notebook*.\n",

    "Python是一门灵活的语言，因此取决于你的目的，可以有几种方式来使用它。\n",
    "Python和其他编程语言的一个区别在于：Python是*解释的*而非*编译的*。\n",
    "这意味着，Python是一行接着一行执行的，因此，Python可以使用一种交互式的方式来执行，这点是许多其他的编译型语言做不到的，比方说Fortran，C或Java。本章将描述四种主要的方式来执行你的Python代码：*Python解释器*，*IPython解释器*，*脚本文件* 或 *Jupyter Notebook*。"
