    "\n",
    "> Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python构思与80年代后期，当时目标作为一门教学和脚本的编程语言，如今它已经成为一个学术界和工业界许多程序猿、攻城狮、研究者和数据科学家必不可少的工具了。\n",
    "\n",
    "> As an astronomer focused on building and promoting the free open tools for data-intensive science, I've found Python to be a near-perfect fit for the types of problems I face day to day, whether it's extracting meaning from large astronomical datasets, scraping and munging data sources from the Web, or automating day-to-day research tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "作为一个致力于创建和促进数据密集型科学的免费开源工具的天文学家，作者发现Python比较完美地解决了这个问题，无论是从海量的天文数据集合中提取有意义的信息，还是从互联网上抓取数据，抑或是自动化日常的研究任务。\n",
    "\n",
    "> The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "对于Python的诉求可以认为是它的简洁和美感，也在于它所具有的完善的生态系统（繁多的工具）给我们带来的便利。\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，大多数的科学计算和数据科学代码都构建在以下一些成熟的和非常有用的程序包之上：\n",
    "\n",
    "> - [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "> - [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "> - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "> - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "> - [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "> - [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, the manuscript for this report was composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) 提供高效多维数组存储和计算\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) 包括大量的数学工具，例如数值积分和数值插入\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 提供一个DataFrame对象，及其强大的方法集进行数据集的操作、过滤、分组和转换\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) 提供一个可达到出版质量的图表生成工具\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) 提供一套标准化、通用的机器学习算法工具集\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) 提供一个增强的终端和一个交互式的笔记本环境，可用于研究性的分析或创建一个交互式可执行的文档。例如，本文档即是使用Jupyter Notebook创建的\n",
    "\n",
    "> No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "除此之外，还有许多工具和程序包构建与上述程序包之上：如果你需要执行一个科学或数据分析任务，有很大机会已经有其他人已经写好了这个程序包给你使用了。\n",
    "\n",
    "> To tap into the power of this data science ecosystem, however, first requires familiarity with the Python language itself.\n",
    "I often encounter students and colleagues who have (sometimes extensive) backgrounds in computing in some language – MATLAB, IDL, R, Java, C++, etc. – and are looking for a brief but comprehensive tour of the Python language that respects their level of knowledge rather than starting from ground zero.\n",
    "This report seeks to fill that niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "想要进入并徜徉在数据科学这个生态大花园，首先需要的是对Python语言本身的熟悉。\n",
    "我经常碰到一些具有计算机程序背景（如MATLAB，IDL，R，Java，C++等等）学生和同事在寻找一个简明扼要但又很容易理解的Python语言教程，该教程应该满足他们目前已有的编程知识，而不是从0开始。\n",
    "这份文档的目的就是填补这个空白。\n",
    "\n",
    "> As such, this report in no way aims to be a comprehensive introduction to programming, or a full introduction to the Python language itself; if that is what you are looking for, you might check out one of the recommended references listed in [Resources for Learning](16-Further-Resources.ipynb).\n",
    "Instead, this will provide a whirlwind tour of some of Python's essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language.\n",
    "My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "因此，本文档的目标并不是针对程序设计的介绍，或者是Python语言的完全介绍。如果这是你所需要的，请查看第16章的[学习资源](16-Further-Resources.ipynb)找到合适你的读物。\n",
    "相反，本文档会为你提供一次旋风般的旅程，途经Python基础语法语义，函数定义、流程控制及其他的一些方面知识。\n",
    "作者的目标是远离语言基础，仅为进一步使用Python进行数据科学学习做准备。"

    "Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities.\n",
    "This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals.\n",
    "Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully-compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this book will use the newer Python 3 syntax.\n",
    "Even though that is the case, the vast majority of code snippets in this book will also work without modification in Python 2: in cases where a Py2-incompatible syntax is used, I will make every effort to note it explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "本文档使用Python 3语法，该版本有一些增强的功能，但是无法与2.x版本兼容。\n",
    "虽然Python 3.0最初是在2008年发布的，但是被接受的速度比较慢，特别是在科学和web开发领域的社区当中。\n",
    "这主要是因为许多的关键程序包和工具都需要花比较长的时间才能使得自己的代码能和新的语法兼容。\n",
    "然而2014年初开始，大部分数据科学生态圈的重要工具都在2和3版本基础上发布了稳定发行版。因此本文档使用新的Python 3语法。\n",
